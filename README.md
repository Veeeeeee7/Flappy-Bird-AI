# Flappy-Bird-AI

This AI creates many neural networks at random and runs them through the flappy bird game. It then finds the best neural network out of these and creates another generation of neural networks based on this nueral network. This continues for many generations until a model is created where the AI can play flappy bird infinitely.
The amount of neural networks per generation and the amount of generations can all be changed. The program also stops once a neural network is deemed "good enough", which can also be changed.
